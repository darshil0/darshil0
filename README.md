## 🚀 About Me

With over 9 years of experience leading quality assurance teams in healthcare IT, I specialize in building robust testing frameworks that protect patient safety while accelerating product delivery. My expertise spans HIPAA, FDA, and ISO compliance testing, with a focus on integrating AI-powered solutions into traditional QA workflows.

I've built and scaled QA Centers of Excellence across three continents, managing globally distributed teams of 15+ professionals. My approach combines strategic thinking with hands-on technical leadership, achieving a 99.7% defect detection rate through intelligent automation and risk-based testing strategies.

Currently, I'm pioneering the integration of LLMs and generative AI into healthcare testing workflows, exploring how artificial intelligence can enhance test coverage, accelerate defect discovery, and improve overall product quality without compromising regulatory compliance.
