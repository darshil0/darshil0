## Leadership Approach

I believe great QA leadership starts with empathy and ends with impact. My teams thrive because I prioritize transparent communication, psychological safety, and continuous learning. I don't just manage quality; I build cultures where quality becomes everyone's responsibility. In healthcare, the stakes are higher than bugs and regressions. Every defect prevented is a patient protected. That principle guides everything I do.
