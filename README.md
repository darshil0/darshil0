## 💡 Leadership Philosophy

**Empathy, Integrity, and Transparent Communication.**
I believe QA is a strategic business enabler, not a cost center. In healthcare, "quality" isn't just a metric—it's patient safety. I build teams that leverage AI to handle the mundane, allowing human expertise to focus on critical safety judgment.
