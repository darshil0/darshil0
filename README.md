# Hi, I'm Darshil Shah 👋

I lead QA teams that prevent patient safety risks, drive measurable business impact, and enable safer healthcare innovation through AI-powered testing.

Most of my work is hands-on: building automation frameworks, implementing AI-driven test strategies, and establishing quality standards that protect patients while accelerating product delivery.

I specialize in healthcare QA with expertise in HIPAA, FDA, and ISO compliance testing, and I'm pioneering the integration of LLMs and generative AI into traditional QA workflows to revolutionize how we test healthcare products.
