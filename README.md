## 💡 Leadership Philosophy

**Empathy, Integrity, and Transparent Communication.**

I believe QA is a strategic business enabler, not a cost center. In healthcare, "quality" isn't just a metric—it's patient safety. I build teams that leverage AI to handle the mundane, allowing human expertise to focus on critical safety judgment.

### Core Beliefs:
- Quality engineering prevents patient safety risks and enables regulatory confidence
- Teams perform best when mentored with empathy and equipped with cutting-edge tools
- AI augments human expertise but never replaces human judgment in safety-critical systems
- Continuous learning and innovation are essential in the rapidly evolving AI landscape
