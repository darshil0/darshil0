## 🧠 Leadership Philosophy

> "Quality engineering is not a phase—it's a culture. The best QA leaders don't just find bugs; they build systems that prevent them from happening in the first place."

**My Testing Approach:**

- **Shift-Left Quality:** Integrate testing from requirements gathering through deployment, not as a bottleneck
- **Risk-Based Testing:** Prioritize testing efforts based on business impact and regulatory requirements
- **Test Automation Strategy:** Automate repetitive tasks, empower testers for exploratory and complex scenarios
- **Compliance by Design:** Build regulatory validation into test frameworks, not as an afterthought
- **Empathy-Driven Leadership:** Mentor QA engineers with understanding, foster innovation and continuous learning
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Use metrics and analytics to continuously improve quality processes
