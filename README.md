# Hi, I'm Darshil Shah 👋

I lead QA teams that prevent patient safety risks, drive measurable business impact, and enable safer healthcare innovation through AI-powered testing.

Most of my work is hands-on: building automation frameworks, implementing AI-driven test strategies, and establishing quality standards that protect patients while accelerating product delivery.
